What is MongoDB? 
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that provides high performance, 
scalability, and flexibility for managing modern, unstructured data. 
Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like 
documents, making it ideal for handling diverse and evolving data structures. 

what is MongoDB Atlas?
MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service provided by MongoDB, designed
to simplify database deployment, management, and scaling. With MongoDB Atlas, developers
can focus on building applications without worrying about infrastructure management

In MongoDB, a cluster refers to a group of servers that work together to store your data 
and ensure high availability and scalability. There are three main types of clusters in MongoDB:
1->Replica Set: This is a group of mongod instances that maintain the same data set. A replica set 
consists of a primary node and one or more secondary nodes. The primary node receives all write 
operations, while secondary nodes replicate the data from the primary node. If the primary node 
fails, one of the secondary nodes is automatically promoted to primary.
2->Sharded Cluster: This type of cluster is used to horizontally scale your database. 
It consists of multiple shards, each of which is a replica set. Data is distributed across shards 
using a shard key, which allows MongoDB to efficiently manage large datasets by splitting 
them into smaller, more manageable pieces.
3->Standalone: Although not typically referred to as a cluster, a standalone MongoDB server is a 
single mongod instance. It's suitable for development, testing, or situations where high availability
and scalability are not required.

Every document requires an _id field which acts as a primary key.
If inserted document is not containing _id field then mongoDB automatically generate
an objectID for the _id field.

objectID is used to create unique identifiers for the _id field

*** connect mongodb atlas through ->[1] mongoshell
1.open terminal
2.(paste the connection string received from atlas->database->connect cluster ->shell->i have shell installed)
 ->mongosh "mongodb+srv://cluster1.g2wrz.mongodb.net/" --apiVersion 1 --username ayajansari
3.provide password mongodb_ayaj or already provided

monshell is a node.js repple environment allow to use varaibles,loops,statemnts,functions. etc.


***connect mongodb atlas through -> [2] mongoDB compass
1.open mongodb compass 
2.(paste the connection string in compass URI received from atlas->database->connect cluster ->compass->i have shell installed)
3. replace <password> with your password and connect
